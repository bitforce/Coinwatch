The code format is specific to me and is most appropriately utilized in a
split-pane view, where one page is the code comment and the other the 
source code and relative comment references. I do this because I 
prefer just to see code when I want to and comments when I want 
to. I may end up creating an optimized Vim plugin to 
automatically search and detect these code comments 
and then open up relative panes containing the 
explanations.
